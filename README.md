# C99 Vulkan Support Library

This is a library written in pure C99 designed to get you 
started in writing your vulkan renderer as fast as possible.
It does not support writing the entire renderer but
supports getting the boilerplate start up out of the way quickly.

- It expects that you WILL be rendering to a surface.
- Right now it only provides platform code for SDL but you
  can use it for other platform but you would have write that
  platform code for yourself.

Use `compile_shaders.py` to build your shader binaries.

The current SPIRV compiler is linux only.  You can download the compiler for other platforms.
Already compiled shaders are added for cross-platform.
